## Hello!
I have (and am creating) some basic projects for everyone to use. Just drag and drop into your existing project and implement them.

You have permission to use anything in this repository, however all I ask is that you share this repo with your friends so they can also save time just like you!

Please note: Use the projects at your own risk, my code is not the cleanest. If you make it cleaner please consider making a merge request :)

|Current Projects| Version |
|-|--|
|Swipe pages | 1 |
|Exit Keyboard | 1 |

## Swipe Pages
With swipe pages, you can easily scroll between multiple views, I have added instructions in the file for how to configure the settings for your projects.
## Exit Keyboard
By default, you cannot escape `UITextField` to fix this download and add exit keyboard to your project and after selecting the Keyboard class on your view controller, you will be able to link the text field using `IBOutlets` and then you can tap to leave or press Done/Enter
