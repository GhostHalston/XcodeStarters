## Hello!
I have (and am creating) some basic projects for everyone to use. Just drag and drop into your existing project and implement them.

You have permission to use anything in this repository, however all I ask is that you share this repo with your friends so they can also save time just like you!

Please note: Use the projects at your own risk, my code is not the cleanest. If you make it cleaner please consider making a merge request :)
